TL;DR: KivyMD is no longer hosted on GitHub. [Find it on GitLab!](https://gitlab.com/kivymd/KivyMD)

For some time now, GitHub has been abandoning its culture of sharing based on the principles of openness, meritocracy and equality for all contributors, regardless of race and gender; all aparently due to pressure from political groups.

Hearing about the [internal restructuring](http://www.businessinsider.com/github-the-full-inside-story-2016-2) over at GitHub was the final nail in the coffin that pushed me to accept that GitHub has lost track of the values that made it grow.

So with that, I (@mixedCase) will stop using GitHub for all my projects and will no longer recommend it for people looking to host theirs.

I will now use GitLab for hosting git repos and my profile can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/u/mixedCase).

So long GitHub, and thanks for all the ~~fish~~git!
